# WildfireGuard AI

**Real-time forest fire detection using AI, deep learning, and cloud technology.**

WildfireGuard AI is a lightweight, real-time forest fire detection system powered by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Designed for deployment on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi and drones, it detects wildfires from images with high accuracy and sends alerts through cloud-connected channels. Built with Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV, the system is scalable, responsive, and focused on protecting the environment.

## Objectives

- Detect forest fires from static images or live video feeds using CNNs  
- Enable real-time alerts to authorities for early intervention  
- Store and access incident data via cloud infrastructure  
- Provide a cost-effective, deployable solution for wildfire-prone areas  

---

## Features

- AI-powered fire vs. non-fire image classification  
- Cloud-ready architecture for scalable deployment  
- Real-time SMS or API-based alert system  
- Over 96% classification accuracy  
- Compatible with edge devices: Raspberry Pi, drones, webcams
